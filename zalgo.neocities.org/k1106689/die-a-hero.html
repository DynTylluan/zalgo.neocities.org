The other day I was looking at my old Windows 98 when I found a .txt called "die-a-hero.html", the date for 
it is March 20, 2003 so I was 15 at the time. It would seem I added color to this HTML file.

FireOverride was 2 years older than me, being 17. From what I can reall the last time I saw FireOverride 
was at an Anime convention in 2008. I'm not so sure what he's up to now, I hear he works in the U.K.

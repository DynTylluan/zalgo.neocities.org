1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as 
it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come a
nd see.

2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> a
bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, 
and to conquer.

3 And when he <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> opened the second seal, I heard the second beast 
say, Come and see.

4 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was give
n to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that th
ey should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sw
ord.

5 And when he <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> opened the third seal, I heard the third beast sa
y, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sa
t on him <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> a pair of balances in his hand.

6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measur
e of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; a
nd see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

7 And when he <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the 
fourth beast say, Come and see.

8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on h
im was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto 
them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and wit
h hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

9 And when he <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the 
souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the test
imony which they held:

10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy
and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwe
ll on the earth?

11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was sa
id unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until 
their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed
as they were, should be fulfilled.

12 And I beheld when he <a href="/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse/some_hope/">had</a> opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there w
as a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hai
r, and the moon became as blood;

13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree 
casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.

14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; 
and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and 
every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the 
mountains;

16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us fro
m the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of
the Lamb:

17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to
stand?

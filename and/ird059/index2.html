The Conet Project: Recordings of Shortwave Numbers 
Stations [ird059]

For more than 30 years the Shortwave radio spectrum has 
been used by the worlds intelligence agencies to transmit 
secret messages. These messages are transmitted by 
hundreds of Numbers Stations.

Shortwave Numbers Stations are a perfect method of 
anonymous, one way communication. Spies located anywhere 
in the world can be communicated to by their masters via 
small, locally available, and unmodified Shortwave 
receivers. The encryption system used by Numbers 
Stations, known as a one time pad is unbreakable. Combine
this with the fact that it is almost impossible to track 
down the message recipients once they are inserted into 
the enemy country, it becomes clear just how powerful the
Numbers Station system is.

These stations use very rigid schedules, and transmit in 
many different languages, employing male and female 
voices repeating strings of numbers or phonetic letters 
day and night, all year round.

The voices are of varying pitches and intonation; there 
is even a German station (The Swedish Rhapsody) that 
transmits a female child's voice!

One might think that these espionage activities should 
have wound down considerably since the official end of 
the cold war, but nothing could be further from the 
truth. Numbers Stations (and by inference, spies) are as 
busy as ever, with many new and bizarre stations 
appearing since the fall of the Berlin wall.

Why is it that in over 30 years, the phenomenon of 
Numbers Stations has gone almost totally unreported? What
are the agencies behind the Numbers Stations, and why are
the eastern European stations still on the air? Why does 
the Czech republic operate a Numbers Station 24 hours a 
day? How is it that Numbers Stations are allowed to 
interfere with essential radio services like air traffic 
control and shipping without having to answer to anybody?
Why does the Swedish Rhapsody Numbers Station use a small
girls voice? 

These are just some of the questions that remain 
unanswered.

Now you will be able to hear this unique and 
extraordinary phenomenon for yourself, as-Discs 
releases THE CONET PROJECT: the first comprehensive 
collection of Numbers Stations recordings released to the
public.

This Quadruple CD is an important historical reference 
work for research into this hitherto unreported and 
unknown field of espionage. The CDs contain 150 
recordings spanning the last twenty years; taken from the
private archives of dedicated shortwave radio listeners 
from around the world. 

There's more information in the included PDF booklet and
